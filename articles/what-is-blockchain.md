Before we understand how blockchain technology works, we need to understand what problems it was designed
to solve.

So let's take a step back and let me ask you a question.
How do we tell if something is fake or real in today's world? for example, a dollar bill, 
a driver's license or a vote in the election?
How do we determine whether it's valid or not?

The answer is, we keep a record of it.

For example, each dollar bill has a serial number that is recorded by the bank.
Your driver's license number is recorded by the DMV and voting records are 
used to track who voted and who didn't so the same person won't be able to vote twice.

But what happens when you want to verify that the document is legit?
You just look it up with the relevant authority. We even have *Notaries*, people who 
are licensed by the government to act as witnesses to attest and record the validity of 
pieces of information or identities.

You'll notice that there is something all of these mechanisms have in common, **they are all centralized**.

Which means there is a Central Authority? whether it's a bank, state office or person that has the power to issue
and validate information.
These central authorities have a lot of power and as you know power may sometimes corrupt.

So what happens if one of these authorities wants to change the facts or even maybe change history a little bit?
This may sound far fetched but even our world history is just a record kept by historians in a centralized manner.

The phrase **"History is written by the Victors"** tells us that facts can sometimes be distorted by those in power.

Today, most money is just a record of who owes what to whom.

This is why **Bitcoin** was born. **Bitcoin** was the first form of money that removes the need for a central authority.

Its records are kept by everyone, not just by central banks. And when everyone is keeping track and verifying the 
facts, well that means that you can no longer change the ledger of transactions whenever something doesn't add up
or because it's more convenient.

You actually have to start being accountable.

But money isn't the only place where decentralization can play a role.

Do you remember those big encyclopedia books we used to rely on when it came to research?

Encyclopedia Britannica employed a hundred full time editors and over 4,000 contributors to publish 
what we consider to be the **authority on knowledge**.

Just imagine the power the editors of these books had in deciding what was worth mentioning, condemning, 
condoning, or ignoring.

Well the last volume of encyclopedia Britannica was published in 2010.

Today, information is much more decentralized with over 130 thousand active editors that maintain different Wikipedia pages.

The risk of any of them "going rogue" unnoticed is much smaller since each edit is public and can be verified by anyone.

**Decentralization** reduces the risk for corruption, fraud and manipulation.

**Blockchain Technology** is a new and innovative way to implement **decentralization**

In a nutshell, Blockchain technology is a solution for the problem of centralization.
It's a system for keeping records by everybody without a any need for a central authority.
A decentralized way of maintaining a ledger that is practically impossible to falsify.

I mean when so many eyes are watching and verifying everything that's being done, it's really hard 
to break the rules unnoticed.

You might be wondering, why is it called Blockchain?

Well, imagine we are maintaining a shared ledger with many pages of records, 
each page begins with a sort of summary of the page before it, if you change part of the 
previous page, you'll also have to change the summary of the current page, so the pages are actually linked 
or chained together.

In technological terms, pages are called blocks, And since each block is linked to the data of the previous block, we have a chain of blocks or a blockchain.

Many people think that **Satoshi Nakamoto**, the mysterious inventor of **Bitcoin** created Blockchain technology.
Technically, he only created the first real life implementation of it, **Bitcoin**.

In fact that world "blockchain" is never even mentioned in Satoshi's original whitepaper. The closest he comes to saying Blockchain is "chain of blocks".

Now that you know what Blockchain technology is, we still have two major questions to answer -
How does it actually work and is blockchain going to change our future?

Lets start with the first question.

Another way to ask this question would be - how do I create a system that allows the creation, verification and updating of records by everybody?

Well, there are four elements a blockchain needs to actually have a life of its own.
1. The first thing required to support a blockchain is a peer-to-peer network - A network of computers, also known as nodes, that are equally privileged. It's open to anyone and everyone. This is basically what we already have today with the **Internet**. We need this network so that we will be able to communicate and share with each other remotely.
2. The second ingredient is Cryptography. **Cryptography** is the art of secure communication in a hostile environment.
